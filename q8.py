prompt_a = """
I am a marketing manager at a retail company and we have just finished 
a three-month campaign. My team has collected customer feedback through 
an online survey and we now have about 500 responses stored in a 
spreadsheet. Each response includes the customer's age group, the 
product they purchased, their satisfaction rating from 1 to 5, and a 
short written comment. I need to present the findings to our CEO next 
Friday in a way that is easy to understand. Can you analyse this data 
for me, highlight which age groups and products have the lowest 
satisfaction scores, identify the most common complaints from the 
written comments, and summarise everything in a short paragraph I can 
use as an executive summary?
